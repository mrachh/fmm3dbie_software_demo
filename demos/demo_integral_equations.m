% Redo Sprime but with integral equation evaluator
S = geometries.sphere(1, 4);



% Solve exterior boundary value problems Helmholz scattering (dirichlet)
% (step 4 + 5) - Show what options are available currently

% Test accuracy artifical solutions (step 6)

% Do a convergence study

% Show merge and repeat exercise


%% User exercise - repeat with favorite boundary value problem, 
% can use surface smoother geometries as well, convergence study
% + post processing routines
